League of Legends Pro Database is a project born from the desire to sharpen my SQL skills while
also working with interesting, real-world data. I have been following professional League of Legends
for the past 5 years and while I could just visit [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/) to view
amazing player and team breakdowns, this doesn't help me learn SQL. If you're wanting a detailed analysis
then I'd recommend checking out [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/). This repository was designed
to provide the curious individual with a database to explore.
