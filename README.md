League of Legends Pro Database is a project born from the desire to sharpen my querying skills while also working with interesting, real-world data. I've been following professional League of Legends for the past 5 years and am always captivated by the stat overlays. While I could just visit [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/) to view amazing breakdowns of players and team, it's WYSIWYG. Frankly, my curisoity doesn't like that; I wanted something I could get hands on with in both creating and exploring - the data carpetner turned Robinson Crusoe. If you're wanting pre-packaged analytic insight then I'd recommend checking out [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/). If you're wanting a playground to learn, hone, and/or explore data then you're at the right spot - this project is aimed at providing the curious individual with a database to explore.
