League of Legends Pro Database is a project born from the desire to sharpen my SQL skills while
also working with interesting, real-world data. I have been following professional League of Legends
for the past 5 years and while I could just visit [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/) to view
amazing player and team breakdowns, this doesn't help me learn SQL. If you're wanting a detailed analysis
then I'd recommend checking out [GameOfLegends](https://gol.gg/esports/home/). This repository was designed
to provide the curious individual with a database to explore.

## Dependencies

* All code is written in Python 3.7.5
   * I have not tested the script on other versions of Python
* Some code depends on the 'pandas' library
    * Clean_Data.py
* Some code depends on the 'numpy' library
    * Clean_Data.py

<code>&nbsp;</code>

## Getting Started

1. Clone or Download the repository
   * If you downloaded the repository, you'll need to extract the contents
2. Run "Clean_Data.py"

</p>

> 2. Run "Clean_Data.py"

After using the provided SQL files to create the relational database, Clean_Data.py proceeds to extract, transform
and load the data into the database. All that's left to do is to connect to the database and start exploring!
